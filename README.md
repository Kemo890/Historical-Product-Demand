## Forecast for Product Demand using XGBoost
In this project, we will be working with a manufacturing company's historical product demand data to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create a forecast using Python.

The primary goal of this project is to gain insights into the data and identify patterns and trends in product demand that could help the manufacturing company make informed decisions about production planning and inventory management. We will be using various statistical and data visualization techniques to perform EDA on the data.

Once we have a better understanding of the data, we will be using time series analysis techniques to create a forecast of product demand. The forecast will help the manufacturing company make informed decisions about production planning, inventory management, and resource allocation.

The project will be implemented using the Python programming language and the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and prohpet. The data used in this project is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/felixzhao/productdemandforecasting).

Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the historical product demand data and create a forecast that can help the manufacturing company optimize their operations and improve their bottom line.
